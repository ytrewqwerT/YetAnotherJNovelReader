# YetAnotherJNovelReader

An (unofficial) alternative to [J-Novel Club](https://j-novel.club/about)'s [official reader app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jnovelapp) for Android since, as of the time of writing, the official app has been riddled with issues with no updates in sight.

## Getting Started

There are currently no plans for the app to be (un)officially released.

If you would like to use the app, you will build and install the app onto your device manually using an IDE of your choice (such as Android Studio).
