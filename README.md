# YetAnotherJNovelReader

An (unofficial) alternative to [J-Novel Club](https://j-novel.club/about)'s [official reader app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jnovelapp) for Android since, as of the time of writing, the official app has been riddled with issues with no updates in sight.

## Features

On top of having most of the features included in the official app (less important features such as external links for purchasing ebooks and the series search functionality are missing):
 - Tag series that you follow and filter new parts and series lists to those parts in those series.
 - An up-next list that shows the next unread part for each followed series as they become available.
 - More complete day/night theme support

The UI is also (subjectively) cleaner and more pleasant to interact with while also being much faster than the official app.

## Installation

Due to the application dealing with sensitive data (JNC login credentials) which general users wouldn't be able to verify the safety of, there are currently no plans for the app to be (un)officially released.

If you trust and would like to use the app, you will need to build and install the app onto your device manually using an appropriate IDE (such as Android Studio). Note that the app requires Android 10 or higher.
